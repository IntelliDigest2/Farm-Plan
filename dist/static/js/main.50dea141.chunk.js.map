produced in the world is\n            discarded or wasted for various reasons. That equates to nearly{\" \"}\n            <b>1.3 billion tons</b> every year.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Not surprisingly, industrialized countries like the United States\n            waste more food than developing nations. In 2010, the average\n            American generated about 219 pounds (99 kg) of food waste, according\n            to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            While you might not think food waste affects you, think again.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            Tossing edible food doesn’t just waste money. Discarded food is sent\n            to landfills, where it rots and produces methane gas, which is the\n            second most common greenhouse gas. In other words, throwing out your\n            food contributes to climate change.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            It wastes a huge amount of water, too. According to the World\n            Resources Institute, 24% of all the water used for agriculture is\n            lost through food waste every year. That’s 45 trillion gallons\n            (about 170 trillion liters).\n            <br />\n            <br /> These things will help to reduce food waste:-{\" \"}\n          </p>\n          <Divider variant=\"middle\" />\n          <p style={{ textAlign: \"left\", padding: \"10px 2% 0 2%\" }}>\n            {\" \"}\n            <h3>1.

Though buying in\n            bulk may be convenient, research has shown that this shopping method\n            leads to more food waste. To avoid buying more food than you need,\n            make frequent trips to the grocery store every few days rather than\n            doing a bulk shopping trip once a week. Make a point to use up all\n            the food you purchased during the last trip to the market before\n            buying more groceries. Additionally, try making a list of items that\n            you need to buy and stick to that list. This will help you reduce\n            impulse buying and reduce food waste as well\n          </p>\n          <Divider variant=\"middle\" />\n          <p style={{ textAlign: \"left\", padding: \"10px 2% 0 2%\" }}>\n            {\" \"}\n            <h3>2.

According\n            to the Natural Resource Defense Council, about two-thirds of\n            household waste in the United Kingdom is due to food spoilage. Many\n            people are unsure how to store fruits and vegetables, which can lead\n            to premature ripening and, eventually, rotten produce. For instance,\n            potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, cucumbers and onions should never be\n            refrigerated. These items should be kept at room temperature.\n            Separating foods that produce more ethylene gas from those that\n            don’t is another great way to reduce food spoilage. Ethylene\n            promotes ripening in foods and could lead to spoilage.\n          </p>\n          <Divider variant=\"middle\" />\n          <p style={{ textAlign: \"left\", padding: \"10px 2% 0 2%\" }}>\n            <h3>3.

Pickling, a type of preservation method using brine or\n            vinegar, may have been used as far back as 2400 BC. Pickling,\n            drying, canning, fermenting, freezing and curing are all methods you\n            can use to make food last longer, thus reducing waste. Not only will\n            these methods shrink your carbon footprint, they will save you money\n            as well. What’s more, most preservation techniques are simple and\n            can be fun. For example, canning an excess of ripe apples and\n            turning them into applesauce, or pickling fresh carrots from the\n            market will provide you with a delicious and long-lasting treat that\n            even kids will enjoy.\n          </p>\n          <Divider variant=\"middle\" />\n          <p style={{ textAlign: \"left\", padding: \"10px 2% 0 2%\" }}>\n            <h3>4.

The consumer demand for flawless fruits and vegetables has led\n            major grocery chains to buy only picture-perfect produce from\n            farmers. This leads to tons of perfectly good food going to waste.\n            It’s such a big issue that major grocery chains like Walmart and\n            Whole Foods have started offering “ugly” fruits and vegetables at a\n            discount in an attempt to reduce waste.

While having a\n            well-stocked fridge can be a good thing, an overly filled fridge can\n            be bad when it comes to food waste. Help avoid food spoilage by\n            keeping your fridge organized so you can clearly see foods and know\n            when they were purchased. A good way to stock your fridge is by\n            using the FIFO method, which stands for “first in, first out.” For\n            example, when you buy a new carton of berries, place the newer\n            package behind the old one. This helps ensure that older food gets\n            used, not wasted.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </PageWrap>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default FoodReduction;\n","import React, { Component
