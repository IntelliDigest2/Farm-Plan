They\r\n                  also come in a variety of forms. The most common and abundant\r\n                  forms are sugars, fibers, and starches. Foods high in\r\n                  carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy diet.\r\n                  Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is\r\n                  converted to energy used to support bodily functions and\r\n                  physical activity. But carbohydrate quality is important; some\r\n                  types of carbohydrate-rich foods are better than others: The\r\n                  healthiest sources of carbohydrates—unprocessed or minimally\r\n                  processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits and beans—promote\r\n                  good health by delivering vitamins, minerals, fiber, and a\r\n                  host of important phytonutrients. Unhealthier sources of\r\n                  carbohydrates include white bread, pastries, sodas, and other\r\n                  highly processed or refined foods.

Every cell in the\r\n                  human body contains protein. The basic structure of protein is\r\n                  a chain of amino acids. We need protein in your diet to help\r\n                  your body repair cells and make new ones. Protein is also\r\n                  important for growth and development in children, teens, and\r\n                  pregnant women. Protein foods are broken down into parts\r\n                  called amino acids during digestion. The human body needs a\r\n                  number of amino acids in large enough amounts to maintain good\r\n                  health. Proteins are found in animal sources such as meats,\r\n                  milk, fish, and eggs. They are also found in plant sources\r\n                  such as soy, beans, legumes, nut butters, and some grains\r\n                  (such as wheat germ and quinoa). The right combination of\r\n                  plant and animal protein helps to balance biodiversity,\r\n                  enhance regenerative agriculture and improve our health.{\" \"}\r\n                </p>\r\n              </Col>\r\n              <Col\r\n                className=\"d-flex justify-content-center\"\r\n                sm={12}\r\n                md={12}\r\n                lg={4}\r\n              >\r\n                <img\r\n                  src={protein}\r\n                  alt=\"protein\"\r\n                  className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\"\r\n                />\r\n              </Col>\r\n            </Row>\r\n\r\n            <Row className=\"pb-5 mb-5 mr-0 ml-0 text-justify about\">\r\n              <Col\r\n                className=\"d-flex justify-content-center\"\r\n                sm={12}\r\n                md={12}\r\n                lg={4}\r\n              >\r\n                <img\r\n                  src={fibre}\r\n                  alt=\"fibre\"\r\n                  className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\"\r\n                />\r\n              </Col>\r\n              <Col>\r\n                <h5>What are Fibres?</h5>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body can’t digest.\r\n                  Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar\r\n                  molecules, fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules,\r\n                  and instead it passes through the body undigested. Fiber helps\r\n                  regulate the body’s use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and\r\n                  blood sugar in check. Children and adults need at least 20 to\r\n                  30 grams of fiber per day for good health, but most Americans\r\n                  get only about 15 grams a day. Great sources are whole fruits\r\n                  and vegetables, whole grains, and beans. Fiber comes in two\r\n                  varieties, both beneficial to health: Soluble fiber, which\r\n                  dissolves in water, can help lower glucose levels as well as\r\n                  help lower blood cholesterol. Foods with soluble fiber include\r\n                  oatmeal, nuts, beans, lentils, apples and blueberries.\r\n                  Insoluble fiber, which does not dissolve in water, can help\r\n                  food move through your digestive system, promoting regularity\r\n                  and helping prevent constipation. Foods with insoluble fibers\r\n                  include wheat, whole wheat bread, whole grain couscous, brown\r\n                  rice, legumes, carrots, cucumbers and tomatoes. The best\r\n                  sources of fiber are whole grains, fresh fruits and\r\n                  vegetables, legumes, and nuts.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </Col>\r\n            </Row>\r\n\r\n            <Row className=\"pb-5 mb-5 mr-0 ml-0 text-justify about\">\r\n              <Col>\r\n                <h5>What are Fats?</h5>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  Rather than adopting a low-fat diet, it’s more important to\r\n                  focus on eating beneficial “good” fats and avoiding harmful\r\n                  “bad” fats. Fat is an important part of a healthy diet. Choose\r\n                  foods with “good” unsaturated fats, limit foods high in\r\n                  saturated fat, and avoid “bad” trans fat. “Good” unsaturated\r\n                  fats — Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — lower\r\n                  disease risk. Foods high in good fats include vegetable oils\r\n                  (such as olive, canola, sunflower, soy, and corn), nuts,\r\n                  seeds, and fish. “Bad” fats — trans fats — increase disease\r\n                  risk, even when eaten in small quantities. Foods containing\r\n                  trans fats are primarily in processed foods made with trans\r\n                  fat from partially hydrogenated oil. Fortunately, trans fats\r\n                  have been eliminated from many of these foods. Saturated fats,\r\n                  while not as harmful as trans fats, by comparison with\r\n                  unsaturated fats negatively impact health and are best\r\n                  consumed in moderation. Foods containing large amounts of\r\n                  saturated fat include red meat, butter, cheese, and ice cream.\r\n                  Some plant-based fats like coconut oil and palm oil are also\r\n                  rich in saturated fat. When you cut back on foods like red\r\n                  meat and butter, replace them with fish, beans, nuts, and\r\n                  healthy oils instead of refined carbohydrates.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </Col>\r\n              <Col\r\n                className=\"d-flex justify-content-center\"\r\n                sm={12}\r\n                md={12}\r\n                lg={4}\r\n              >\r\n                <img\r\n                  src={fat}\r\n                  alt=\"fat\"\r\n                  className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\"\r\n                />\r\n              </Col>\r\n            </Row>\r\n\r\n            {/* <Row className=\"pb-5 mb-5 mr-0 ml-0 text-justify about\">\r\n                <Col className=\"d-flex justify-content-center\"sm={12} md={12} lg={4}>\r\n\r\n                </Col>\r\n            </Row> */}\r\n\r\n            <h3 style={{ marginTop: \"-5%\", marginBottom: \"2.5%\" }}>\r\n              Recommended Daily Nutrient Intake\r\n            </h3>\r\n\r\n            {/* \r\n              Conditional rendering/ternary operators used again here to alter the table upon clicking certian options from this dropdown menu.\r\n              This example makes use of the 'useState' hook since this is a 'functional component' rather than a 'class component' (where you would make use of 'this.setState({ ... })' )\r\n              More info/help on this: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html\r\n            */}\r\n\r\n            <Dropdown>\r\n              <DropdownToggle\r\n                className=\"custom-btn\"\r\n                style={{ marginBottom: \"2.5%\" }}\r\n              >\r\n                Select Age Group\r\n              </DropdownToggle>\r\n              <DropdownMenu>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    0-5\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    5-10\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    10-15\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    15-20\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    70-75\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    75-80\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n              </DropdownMenu>\r\n            </Dropdown>\r\n\r\n            <div>\r\n              {tableView === \"0-5\" ?

food waste and repurposing inedible waste to\r\n                climate friendly chemicals is at the core of everything we do.\r\n                We believe that reducing food waste at food production, retail,\r\n                and household level can provide numerous benefits for both the\r\n                planet and our communities.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Through our research and consulting facilities, IntelliDigest is\r\n                continuously working on helping governments and the public\r\n                understand the true scale of the food waste issue and the\r\n                consequences of inadequate food waste handling. Advocating for\r\n                increased awareness about measuring food waste inspired our\r\n                Global Food Loss & Waste Tracker system, designed to allow\r\n                households to monitor their efforts and save money through\r\n                reducing food waste.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"para\">\r\n            <Col>\r\n              <h1>The Global Food Loss & Waste Tracker</h1>\r\n              <img\r\n                src={placeholder}\r\n                alt=\"Placeholder\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\"\r\n              />\r\n              <p>\r\n                The biggest threat faced by our planet today is derived from the\r\n                way that we produce and consume food.

Alarmingly, 70% of food wastage\r\n                across the world comes from household waste.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                IntelliDigest have used innovative research and technology to\r\n                tackle the problem of household waste by developing the Global\r\n                Food Loss & Waste Tracker.

They also come in\r\n                a variety of forms. The most common and abundant forms are\r\n                sugars, fibers, and starches. Foods high in carbohydrates are an\r\n                important part of a healthy diet. Carbohydrates provide the body\r\n                with glucose, which is converted to energy used to support\r\n                bodily functions and physical activity. But carbohydrate quality\r\n                is important; some types of carbohydrate-rich foods are better\r\n                than others: The healthiest sources of carbohydrates—unprocessed\r\n                or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits and\r\n                beans—promote good health by delivering vitamins, minerals,\r\n                fiber, and a host of important phytonutrients. Unhealthier\r\n                sources of carbohydrates include white bread, pastries, sodas,\r\n                and other highly processed or refined foods.

The Healthy Eating Plate recommends filling most of\r\n                your plate with healthy carbohydrates – with vegetables (except\r\n                potatoes) and fruits taking up about half of your plate, and\r\n                whole grains filling up about one fourth of your plate.{\" \"}\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"para\">\r\n            <Col>\r\n              <h4>What are Proteins?</h4>\r\n              <img\r\n                src={protein}\r\n                alt=\"protein\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\"\r\n              />\r\n              <p>\r\n                Proteins are the building blocks of life.

Proteins\r\n                are found in animal sources such as meats, milk, fish, and eggs.\r\n                They are also found in plant sources such as soy, beans,\r\n                legumes, nut butters, and some grains (such as wheat germ and\r\n                quinoa). The right combination of plant and animal protein helps\r\n                to balance biodiversity, enhance regenerative agriculture and\r\n                improve our health.{\" \"}\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"para\">\r\n            <Col>\r\n              <h4>What are Fibres?</h4>\r\n              <img\r\n                src={fibre}\r\n                alt=\"fibre\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\"\r\n              />\r\n              <p>\r\n                Fiber is a type of carbohydrate that the body can’t digest.\r\n                Though most carbohydrates are broken down into sugar molecules,\r\n                fiber cannot be broken down into sugar molecules, and instead it\r\n                passes through the body undigested. Fiber helps regulate the\r\n                body’s use of sugars, helping to keep hunger and blood sugar in\r\n                check. Children and adults need at least 20 to 30 grams of fiber\r\n                per day for good health, but most Americans get only about 15\r\n                grams a day. Great sources are whole fruits and vegetables,\r\n                whole grains, and beans. Fiber comes in two varieties, both\r\n                beneficial to health: Soluble fiber, which dissolves in water,\r\n                can help lower glucose levels as well as help lower blood\r\n                cholesterol. Foods with soluble fiber include oatmeal, nuts,\r\n                beans, lentils, apples and blueberries. Insoluble fiber, which\r\n                does not dissolve in water, can help food move through your\r\n                digestive system, promoting regularity and helping prevent\r\n                constipation. Foods with insoluble fibers include wheat, whole\r\n                wheat bread, whole grain couscous, brown rice, legumes, carrots,\r\n                cucumbers and tomatoes. The best sources of fiber are whole\r\n                grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, legumes, and nuts.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"para\">\r\n            <Col>\r\n              <h4>What are Fats?</h4>\r\n              <img\r\n                src={fat}\r\n                alt=\"fat\"\r\n                className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\"\r\n              />\r\n              <p>\r\n                Rather than adopting a low-fat diet, it’s more important to\r\n                focus on eating beneficial “good” fats and avoiding harmful\r\n                “bad” fats. Fat is an important part of a healthy diet. Choose\r\n                foods with “good” unsaturated fats, limit foods high in\r\n                saturated fat, and avoid “bad” trans fat. “Good” unsaturated\r\n                fats — Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats — lower disease\r\n                risk. Foods high in good fats include vegetable oils (such as\r\n                olive, canola, sunflower, soy, and corn), nuts, seeds, and fish.\r\n                “Bad” fats — trans fats — increase disease risk, even when eaten\r\n                in small quantities. Foods containing trans fats are primarily\r\n                in processed foods made with trans fat from partially\r\n                hydrogenated oil. Fortunately, trans fats have been eliminated\r\n                from many of these foods. Saturated fats, while not as harmful\r\n                as trans fats, by comparison with unsaturated fats negatively\r\n                impact health and are best consumed in moderation. Foods\r\n                containing large amounts of saturated fat include red meat,\r\n                butter, cheese, and ice cream. Some plant-based fats like\r\n                coconut oil and palm oil are also rich in saturated fat. When\r\n                you cut back on foods like red meat and butter, replace them\r\n                with fish, beans, nuts, and healthy oils instead of refined\r\n                carbohydrates.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </Col>\r\n          </div>\r\n\r\n          <div className=\"para\">\r\n            <h4>Recommended Daily Nutrient Intake</h4>\r\n\r\n            <Dropdown>\r\n              <DropdownToggle\r\n                className=\"custom-btn\"\r\n                style={{\r\n                  marginBottom: \"2.5%\",\r\n                  left: \"50%\",\r\n                  right: \"50%\",\r\n                  transform: \"translate(75%, 0%)\",\r\n                }}\r\n              >\r\n                Select Age Group\r\n              </DropdownToggle>\r\n              <DropdownMenu>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    0-5\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    5-10\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    10-15\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    15-20\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    70-75\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n                <DropdownItem>\r\n                  <div onClick={(e) => setTableView(e.target.textContent)}>\r\n                    75-80\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </DropdownItem>\r\n              </DropdownMenu>\r\n            </Dropdown>\r\n\r\n            <div>\r\n              {tableView === \"0-5\" ?

<BrowserView><h1>Food Waste Reduction Tips</h1></BrowserView>\n\n        <p style={{textAlign: 'left', padding: '10px 20% 0 20%'}}>Food waste is a bigger problem than many people realize.\n<br/><br/>\nIn fact, nearly one-third of all food produced in the world is discarded or wasted for various reasons. That equates to nearly <b>1.3 billion tons</b> every year.\n<br/><br/>\nNot surprisingly, industrialized countries like the United States waste more food than developing nations. In 2010, the average American generated about 219 pounds (99 kg) of food waste, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n<br/><br/>\nWhile you might not think food waste affects you, think again.\n<br/><br/>\nTossing edible food doesn’t just waste money. Discarded food is sent to landfills, where it rots and produces methane gas, which is the second most common greenhouse gas. In other words, throwing out your food contributes to climate change.\n<br/><br/>\nIt wastes a huge amount of water, too. According to the World Resources Institute, 24% of all the water used for agriculture is lost through food waste every year. That’s 45 trillion gallons (about 170 trillion liters).<br/><br/> These things will help to reduce food waste:- </p>\n<p style={{textAlign: 'left', padding: '10px 20% 0 20%'}}> <h3>1. Shop Smart:-</h3> <img src={tip1} alt=\"tip1\" className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\" /> Most people tend to buy more food than they need.\n\nThough buying in bulk may be convenient, research has shown that this shopping method leads to more food waste.\n\nTo avoid buying more food than you need, make frequent trips to the grocery store every few days rather than doing a bulk shopping trip once a week.\n\nMake a point to use up all the food you purchased during the last trip to the market before buying more groceries.\n\nAdditionally, try making a list of items that you need to buy and stick to that list. This will help you reduce impulse buying and reduce food waste as well</p>\n<p style={{textAlign: 'left', padding: '10px 20% 0 20%'}}> <h3>2. Store Food Correctly:-</h3> <img src={tip2} alt=\"tip2\" className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\" /> Improper storage leads to a massive amount of food waste.\n\nAccording to the Natural Resource Defense Council, about two-thirds of household waste in the United Kingdom is due to food spoilage.\n\nMany people are unsure how to store fruits and vegetables, which can lead to premature ripening and, eventually, rotten produce.\n\nFor instance, potatoes, tomatoes, garlic, cucumbers and onions should never be refrigerated. These items should be kept at room temperature.\n\nSeparating foods that produce more ethylene gas from those that don’t is another great way to reduce food spoilage. Ethylene promotes ripening in foods and could lead to spoilage.</p>\n\n<p style={{textAlign: 'left', padding: '10px 20% 0 20%'}}><h3>3. Learn to Preserve:-</h3> <img src={tip3} alt=\"tip3\" className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\" /> While you might think fermenting and pickling are new fads, food preservation techniques like these have been used for thousands of years.\n\nPickling, a type of preservation method using brine or vinegar, may have been used as far back as 2400 BC.\n\nPickling, drying, canning, fermenting, freezing and curing are all methods you can use to make food last longer, thus reducing waste.\n\nNot only will these methods shrink your carbon footprint, they will save you money as well. What’s more, most preservation techniques are simple and can be fun.\n\nFor example, canning an excess of ripe apples and turning them into applesauce, or pickling fresh carrots from the market will provide you with a delicious and long-lasting treat that even kids will enjoy.</p>\n\n<p style={{textAlign: 'left', padding: '10px 20% 0 20%'}}><h3>4. Don’t Be a Perfectionist:-</h3> <img src={tip4} alt=\"tip4\" className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\" /> Did you know that rummaging through a bin of apples until you find the most perfect-looking one contributes to food waste?\n\nThough identical in taste and nutrition, so-called “ugly” fruits and vegetables get passed up for produce that is more pleasing to the eye.\n\nThe consumer demand for flawless fruits and vegetables has led major grocery chains to buy only picture-perfect produce from farmers. This leads to tons of perfectly good food going to waste.\n\nIt’s such a big issue that major grocery chains like Walmart and Whole Foods have started offering “ugly” fruits and vegetables at a discount in an attempt to reduce waste.\n\nDo your part by choosing slightly imperfect produce at the grocery store, or better yet, directly from the farmer.\n\n</p>\n\n<p style={{textAlign: 'left', padding: '10px 20% 50px 20%'}}><h3>5. Keep Your Fridge Clutter-Free:-</h3> <img src={tip5} alt=\"tip5\" className=\"img-fluid rounded fix-image\" /> You’ve probably heard the saying, “out of sight, out of mind.” This rings especially true when it comes to food.\n\nWhile having a well-stocked fridge can be a good thing, an overly filled fridge can be bad when it comes to food waste.\n\nHelp avoid food spoilage by keeping your fridge organized so you can clearly see foods and know when they were purchased.\n\nA good way to stock your fridge is by using the FIFO method, which stands for “first in, first out.”\n\nFor example, when you buy a new carton of berries, place the newer package behind the old one. This helps ensure that older food gets used, not wasted.\n\n</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default FoodReduction","import React, { Component } from \"react\";\nimport { connect } from \"react-redux\";\nimport { Redirect } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport { firestoreConnect } from \"react-redux-firebase\";\nimport { compose } from \"redux\";\nimport \"../../index.css\";\n\nclass InfoTable extends Component {\n  renderTableData() {\n    return (\n      this.props.users &&\n      this.props.users.map((student, index) => {\n        const {\n          id,\n          email,\n          firstName,\n          lastName,\n          address,\n          city,\n          country,\n          postcode,\n          buildingFunction,\n        } = student; //destructuring\n        return (\n          <tr key={id}>\n            <td>{id}</td>\n            <td>\n              {firstName} {lastName}\n            </td>\n            <td>{email}</td>\n            <td>{buildingFunction}</td>\n            <td>\n              {address}, {city}, {country}, {postcode}\n            </td>\n          </tr>\n        );\n      })\n    );\n  }\n\n  renderTableHeader() {\n    return;\n  }\n  render() {\n    if (!this.props.auth.uid) return <Redirect to=\"/login\" />;\n    if (\"user\" === this.props.profile.type) return <Redirect to=\"/\" />;\n    return (\n      <div style={{ paddingBottom: \"50px\", paddingTop: \"70px\" }}>\n        <h1 id=\"title\">\n          The People who have signed in -{\" \"}\n          {this.props.users ? this.props.users.length : 0}\n        </h1>\n        <table id=\"students\">\n          <tbody>\n            <tr>\n              <th>ID</th>\n              <th>NAME</th>\n              <th>EMAIL</th>\n              <th>BUILDING FUNTION</th>\n              <th>ADDRESS</th>\n            </tr>\n            {this.renderTableData()}\n          </tbody>\n        </table>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nconst mapStateToProps = (state) => {\n  // console.log(state);\n  return {\n    auth: state.firebase.auth,\n    profile: state.firebase.profile,\n    users: state.firestore.ordered.users,\n  };\n};\n\nexport default compose(\n  connect(mapStateToProps),\n  firestoreConnect((props) => {\n    if (!props.auth.uid) return [];\n    return [\n      {\n        collection: \"users\",\n        doc: props.auth.uid,\n      },\n    ];\n  })\n)(InfoTable);\n","import React, {Component} from \"react\";\nimport \"../../../App.css\";\nimport \"../Pages.css\"\nimport {Button, Card, Col, Row, Tab, Nav, InputGroup, Form, Modal} from 'react-bootstrap'\nimport styled from \"styled-components\";\nimport {BsSearch} from \"react-icons/bs\"\nimport { BrowserView, MobileView } from \"react-device-detect\";\nimport {Accordion, AccordionSummary, AccordionDetails, Typography, Divider} from \"@material-ui/core\"\nimport {BsArrowReturnLeft, BsArrow90DegLeft} from \"react-icons/bs\"\nimport {Link} from \"react-router-dom\"\n\nclass BrowseProducts extends Component{\n\n    state = {\n        // tabClicked: false,\n        // tabColour: \"#aab41e\"\n        showDevMessage: false\n\n    }\n\n    // handleTabClick = (e) => {\n    //     this.setState({tabClicked: !this.state.tabClicked})\n\n    //     if (!this.state.tabClicked){\n    //         this.setState({tabColour: \"#aab41e\"})\n    //     } else {\n    //         this.setState({tabColour: \"rgb(55, 85, 54)\"})\n    //     }\n    // }\n\n    componentDidMount(){\n        this.setState({showDevMessage: true})\n    }\n\n    render(){\n        return (\n            <>\n\n            <Modal show={this.state.showDevMessage} onHide={() => this.setState({showDevMessage: !this.state.showDevMessage})}>\n                <Modal.Header closeButton>\n                    <Modal.Title>Note</Modal.Title>\n                </Modal.Header>\n                <Modal.Body>\n                    <p>This page is in the very early stages of development.
